# Overview of TD

TD is made up of two parts : the backend and the frontend.  The backend is a [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) application that offers a REST api and interfaces with databases using [SQLAlchemy](http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/2.1/).  The frontend is an [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) application.
