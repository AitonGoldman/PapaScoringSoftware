# change all urls that are hardcoded (i.e. images, submit_links,etc) to...?
# need a way to deal with "oops - I put the wrong person on the machine and now it's time to record their score"

# need a way to deal with "oops - I added someone on a machine, but it turns out it's the wrong person - how do I undo on a queue division?"
# add a refresh button where appropriate (queues, results, ?)

# don't allow "undo player add" on divisions with queues/deal with this
# fix add player to machine css
# add tests for queue bumping 
# add unit tests for Queue/modified DivisionMachine

# add css for token_select
# fix back button
# move pic and animation css out from ionic-app.scss
# make sure route tests are using the shared orm creation code
# make sure all routes that take input assume a string coming in

# refactor add/remove machines to be shared_html/js
# refactoring tournament shared html and js
# refactoring integration/unit tests
# need default value for max_tokens in td_config (and defaults in general)

bugs
# bug : deal with editing division name

remember to go back to...
# handle player purchase more elegantly (really needed?)
# check out td_integeration_test setup - specifically regarding setting app config params(i.e. secret key, etc)
## remember to look through tests where we get env vars directly right now
# remember to modify division_machine tests when adding finals

tasks - functional - long term
# add "confirm on backend" to protractor tests
# make sure integration tests are not sqllite specific
# add "initialize db" script which calls routes
