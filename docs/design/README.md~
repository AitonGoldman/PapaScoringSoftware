# Papa Scoring Software Architecture

## Overview
The Papa Scoring Software is pinball tournament scoring software that is designed to meet the following requirements:

- It must support desktop and mobile browsers
- It must be scalable 
- It must be easy to add on new features
- It must be fast
- It must use off the shelf libraries/frameworks when possible

The PSS backend is a REST server built on Flask with a Postgres database.  The PSS frontend is built on Ionic.  The rest of this document describes the design of the PSS.

## Some Definitons...

Before we begin, we need to go over some definitions :
- An `Event` (i.e. PAPA 20) contains a number of `Tournaments`.
- A `PSS User` can create and edit `Events`.
- A `PSS Event User` is a user involved in running the tournament (i.e. deskworker, scorekeeper, TD, etc).
- A `PSS Event User` who has TD permissions can create `Tournaments` 
- A `Player` is a player registered in a specific event.
