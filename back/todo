bugs
# bug : deal with editing division name

remember to go back to...
# handle player purchase more elegantly (really needed?)
# check out td_integeration_test setup - specifically regarding setting app config params(i.e. secret key, etc)
## remember to look through tests where we get env vars directly right now
# remember to modify division_machine tests when adding finals


tasks - functional - long term
# add "confirm on backend" to protractor tests
# make sure integration tests are not sqllite specific
# add "initialize db" script which calls routes 

scratchpad - queue :

caching
# cached info
## divisions - if cached : 
### add end date
### check if end date has been reached
## players - ?
## division machines - allow for manual refresh of cache
## logout needs to wipe cache

scratchpad - audit log
# audit_log
## need a "audit log" for each object - i.e. each object has a list of "audit_log" objects
## example : a token has a "created" and "used" object in it's "audit_logs" field

# use cases
## My score disappeared(aka My score got assigned to someone else)
## I should have more tokens
## My ticket got voided prematurely
## There is a score I didn't record

# My score disappeared
## possible reasons : assigned to wrong person, never properly submitted, voided
## how to find number 1 : work back in history of games played for player, try and identify timeframe of missing game, get a list of scores recorded in that division at that time
## how to find number 2 : same as 1, can find scorekeepers, ask to verify?
## how to find number 3 : same as number 1 - a complete history which includes voids

# I should have more tokens
## possible reasons : they are wrong, desk made a mistake, void prematurely
## how to find number 1 : have a history - show their complete purchase history(backwards - with summaries at each purchase point), and side by side with thier usage history (also backwards)
## how to find number 2 : compare with stripe/square history; if they paid cash, they are SOL
## how to find number 3 : same as number 1, with voids

# My ticket got voided without me saying so
## get scorekeepr name from voiding, try and confirm

# common elements
## player_id, team_id, action(game_started,score_recorded, void), time stamp, scorekeeper(user_id), data(score_entered)
## associated with token

## player_id, team_id, action(purchased), time stamp, desk_worker(user_id)
## associated with token
